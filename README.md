## What This Is

A paginated, self-contained HTML guide covering everything from setting up Claude Code to shipping your first product — written for founders, not developers. Every section includes plain-English explainers, copy-paste Claude prompts, and interactive checklists.

**11 sections:**
- Setup — getting Claude Code running
- Start Here — how to think about AI-assisted building
- Prompting — writing prompts that actually work
- Features — scoping and building core functionality
- UI/UX — making it look and feel right
- Backend — databases, auth, APIs
- Hosting — getting it live
- GitHub — version control without the headache
- Security — what you actually need to worry about
- Beyond — scaling and next steps
- Launch — the full go-to-market playbook
